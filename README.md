# Mortgage Database System

A comprehensive **Graph Database** system built on Neo4j, specifically designed for AI agents and mortgage specialists to leverage relationship-driven insights and intelligent business rule processing.

## 🎯 Why Graph Database for Mortgage Processing?

### The Problem with Traditional RDBMS Approach
Traditional relational databases struggle with mortgage processing because:
- **Complex JOIN operations** required for relationship analysis become expensive
- **Fixed schema** limitations when handling diverse document types and evolving regulations
- **Poor performance** for network analysis (fraud detection, referral quality assessment)
- **Difficulty modeling** multi-degree relationships between entities

### Graph Database Advantages for Mortgages

#### 1. **Relationship-First Data Model**
```cypher
// Find all loans where borrower's employment history connects to high-risk employers
MATCH (borrower:Person)-[:WORKS_AT]->(employer:Company)-[:FLAGGED_AS]->(:RiskIndicator)
MATCH (borrower)-[:APPLIES_FOR]->(loan:Application)
RETURN loan, borrower, employer
```

#### 2. **Complex Risk Assessment Through Networks**
- **Fraud Detection**: Identify suspicious patterns across borrower networks
- **Referral Quality**: Analyze performance of real estate agent → loan officer → lender chains
- **Property Risk**: Track property ownership chains and market patterns
- **Income Verification**: Cross-reference employment networks and income claims

#### 3. **AI Agent Native Integration**
```cypher
// AI Agent can directly query and reason about relationships
MATCH (app:Application)-[:SUBJECT_TO]->(rule:BusinessRule)
WHERE app.application_id = $app_id 
  AND rule.rule_type = 'CreditScoreAssessment'
RETURN rule.decision_criteria, rule.required_actions
```

#### 4. **Real-Time Decision Making**
- **Automated Underwriting**: Rules engine with graph-based logic
- **Document Intelligence**: Smart requirement detection based on application characteristics  
- **Risk Scoring**: Multi-dimensional risk assessment using relationship patterns
- **Compliance Checking**: Regulatory rule application with context awareness

## 🤖 AI Agent Integration

### Direct Cypher Access for Intelligent Processing

**AI agents can directly execute Cypher queries** for complete mortgage processing workflow:

#### 🤖 **Application Intake Agent**
```cypher
// Create new mortgage application with borrower
CREATE (p:Person {
    person_id: "PER_2025_001",
    first_name: "Sarah", 
    last_name: "Johnson",
    email: "sarah.johnson@email.com",
    credit_score: 750,
    monthly_income: 9200
})
CREATE (app:Application {
    application_id: "APP_2025_001",
    loan_amount: 425000,
    loan_purpose: "purchase",
    status: "received",
    application_date: datetime(),
    monthly_income: 9200,
    down_payment_percentage: 0.20
})
CREATE (p)-[:APPLIES_FOR]->(app)
RETURN app.application_id, app.status
```

#### 🤖 **Document Verification Agent**
```cypher
// Check what documents are still needed
MATCH (app:Application {application_id: "APP_2025_001"})
MATCH (rule:DocumentVerificationRule)
WHERE rule.rule_type = "PAY_STUB_STANDARD"
OPTIONAL MATCH (app)-[:REQUIRES]->(d:Document {document_type: "pay_stub"})
WITH app, rule, d
WHERE d IS NULL
RETURN rule.description as missing_document, rule.requirements
```

#### 🤖 **Underwriting Agent**
```cypher
// Apply business rules and make qualification decision
MATCH (app:Application {application_id: "APP_2025_001"})
WITH app, (app.monthly_debts * 1.0 / app.monthly_income) as dti_ratio
SET app.dti_ratio = dti_ratio,
    app.qualification_status = CASE
        WHEN dti_ratio <= 0.28 THEN "qualified"
        WHEN dti_ratio <= 0.43 THEN "qualified_with_conditions" 
        ELSE "not_qualified"
    END,
    app.status = CASE 
        WHEN dti_ratio <= 0.28 THEN "approved"
        WHEN dti_ratio <= 0.43 THEN "conditional_approval"
        ELSE "denied" 
    END
RETURN app.qualification_status, app.status
```

#### 🤖 **Risk Assessment Agent**  
```cypher
// Find similar applications for risk comparison
MATCH (target:Application {application_id: "APP_2025_001"})
MATCH (similar:Application)
WHERE similar.status = "approved" 
  AND abs(similar.credit_score - target.credit_score) <= 50
  AND abs(similar.loan_amount - target.loan_amount) <= 50000
MATCH (similar)-[:ELIGIBLE_FOR]->(lp:LoanProgram)
RETURN similar.application_id, similar.credit_score, 
       similar.loan_amount, lp.name as recommended_program
LIMIT 5
```

#### 🤖 **Workflow Management Agent**
```cypher
// Find applications needing attention
MATCH (app:Application)
WHERE app.status IN ["incomplete", "in_review"]
  AND datetime() - app.application_date > duration("P7D")
RETURN app.application_id, app.status, 
       duration.between(app.application_date, datetime()).days as days_pending
ORDER BY days_pending DESC
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🔧 AI Agent Development

### Connection Management
```python
from utils.neo4j_connection import Neo4jConnection

# Simple connection for AI agents
conn = Neo4jConnection()
success = conn.connect()
if success:
    result, summary, keys = conn.execute_query(your_cypher_query)
    # Process results
    conn.disconnect()
```

### Application Storage
```python
from utils.application_storage import store_application_data, MortgageApplicationData

# Create new application
app_data = MortgageApplicationData(
    application_id="APP_2025_001",
    first_name="John",
    last_name="Doe",
    loan_amount=350000
    # ... other fields
)
success, app_id = store_application_data(app_data)
```

### Common Agent Patterns
```cypher
-- Get all business rules applicable to an application
MATCH (app:Application {application_id: $app_id})
MATCH (app)-[:SUBJECT_TO]->(rule:BusinessRule)  
RETURN rule.rule_type, rule.description, rule.criteria

-- Update application status
MATCH (app:Application {application_id: $app_id})
SET app.status = $new_status, app.updated_at = datetime()
RETURN app.status

-- Find missing documents  
MATCH (app:Application {application_id: $app_id})
MATCH (rule:DocumentVerificationRule)
OPTIONAL MATCH (app)-[:REQUIRES]->(d:Document {document_type: rule.document_type})
WHERE d IS NULL
RETURN rule.document_type as missing_document

-- Calculate qualification score
MATCH (app:Application {application_id: $app_id})
WITH app, 
     CASE WHEN app.credit_score >= 740 THEN 10 ELSE 5 END as credit_points,
     CASE WHEN app.dti_ratio <= 0.28 THEN 10 ELSE 5 END as dti_points  
SET app.qualification_score = credit_points + dti_points
RETURN app.qualification_score
```
